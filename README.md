# TDD

* What is TDD? - Test Driven Development 
* Why - Test our code before pushing it to production
* We use pytest and 

```bash
important points

test file MUST INCLUDE KEY WORD TEST
calc_test
```
- [x] `pip install pytest`
- [x] `pip install unittest2`

A test file will be reocgnise by adding pytest module if _test is added after the file name. In our example, calc and 
calc_test has been used

- [x] Follow the proces of:
* `TEST`
* `PASS` or `FAIL`
* `REFACTOR`

Process of backwards engineering is required. To test the processes first, which gives a pass or fail, then the variables
are define later.
